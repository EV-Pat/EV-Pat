- 👋 Hi, I’m EV-Pat.  
- 👀
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use ESP32 controllers for a high altitude balloon launch.
- 💞️ I’m comparing the Arduino IDE to MicroPython for coding. 
- I need to learn to use Bluetooth between two ESP32's, how to read a GPS module,
- and an altimeter, and to output control features during flight.
- I'm at the 'blink an LED' stage and welcome help :)
- 📫 You can reach me at pmcneill@sbcglobal.net
